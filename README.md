## content-moderation-service

We want to moderate the text and images when admins are creating a post.
I have been playing with google cloud apis.

This should be refactored a little and moved to playmaker at some point.
We want this services to be usable for any future features that might want to do this.

TODO
-  Refactor
-  Add a google cloud key to use the apis
-  Once you get it working, Chat with Nestor and see whats required if we want to get this running on playmaker and how we could generate keys for other envs.
